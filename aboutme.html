    			<p>Hello, my name is Michelynne Lopez, I’m a student at Northwest Vista College majoring in Digital Media. I’ve always been drawn to creativity and storytelling, and 	photography has become my way of capturing life’s most special moments. That’s why I’m creating a photography website—so I can showcase my work and, more importantly, connect with people who might otherwise feel photography is out of reach.<br><br>
				I got into photography because I’ve seen how meaningful it is to preserve memories. Growing up, I noticed how families, especially those on tighter budgets, often had to choose between necessities and things like professional family photos. It didn’t seem fair to me that something as beautiful as capturing 	milestones—graduations, birthdays, or just the simple joy of being together—should feel like a luxury.<br><br>
				That’s when I decided I wanted to do things differently. My goal isn’t just to take pictures but to create an experience where people feel seen, valued, and at ease. My website will make it easy for anyone to find me, browse my work, and book a session without stressing over costs.<br><br>
				I believe everyone deserves to look back at their life through beautiful photographs, no matter their budget. That’s why I strive to keep my services accessible while ensuring my work reflects the care and creativity that every moment deserves.<br><br>
				For me, photography isn’t just a career path; it’s a way to help people hold onto their memories forever. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me and the stories I’ll get to capture along the way.</p>
